            I am Lirim Hyseni, 28 years old from Presheve, a small city in
            Serbia. I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in
            Computer Science. That same year, I started an internship at
            Blackstone EIT for four months, which led to a full-time position as
            a Junior Front-End Developer. I gained extensive experience working
            on web development and web design projects alongside a great team.
            In addition to my full-time role, I also worked as a freelance
            developer, completing various projects for small companies. I am
            always eager to learn new technologies and take on new challenges!
