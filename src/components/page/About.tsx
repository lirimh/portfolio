              I am Lirim Hyseni, 28 years old from Presheve, a small city in
              Serbia. I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in
              Computer Science from the University for Business and Technology
              in Prishtina. My career began in early 2019 with an internship at
              Blackstone EIT, which quickly turned into a full-time position as
              a Front-End Developer. There, I gained valuable experience working
              on various web development projects and collaborating closely with
              a talented team.

            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed sm:leading-relaxed lg:leading-relaxed">
              Afterwards, I continued my journey as a Front-End and WordPress
              Developer at CNW GmbH, where I was responsible for creating and
              maintaining websites for different businesses. Since 2023, I have
              been working at Innovative Solutions, contributing to the
              development of e-commerce platforms and ERP systems, helping
              deliver high-quality solutions for clients.

              Alongside my full-time roles, I have also worked as a freelance
              developer, successfully completing a range of projects for small
              companies. I&apos;m passionate about continuous learning,
              improving my skills, and taking on new challenges! ðŸ˜Š
