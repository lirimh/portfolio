            I am Lirim Hyseni, 28 years old from Presheve, a small city in
            Serbia. I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in
            Computer Science from the University for Business and Technology in
            Prishtina. My career began in early 2019 with an internship at
            Blackstone EIT, which quickly turned into a full-time position as a
            Front-End Developer. There, I gained valuable experience working on
            various web development projects and collaborating closely with a
            talented team. Afterwards, I continued my journey as a Front-End and
            WordPress Developer at CNW GmbH, where I was responsible for
            creating and maintaining websites for different businesses. Since
            2023, I have been working at Innovative Solutions, contributing to
            the development of e-commerce platforms and ERP systems, helping
            deliver high-quality solutions for clients. Alongside my full-time
            roles, I have also worked as a freelance developer, successfully
            completing a range of projects for small companies. I&apos;m
            passionate about continuous learning, improving my skills, and
            taking on new challenges! ðŸ˜Š
